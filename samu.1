.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
loads a build manifest from
.Ar buildfile
and rebuilds
.Ar targets
if they are out of date.
If no targets are specified, the manifest's default targets are built.
If there are no default targets, the leaf nodes of the dependency graph are
built (outputs that have no consuming action).
.Pp
Targets are out of date if they are older than the generating action's newest
input, they have no entry in the build log, or if the command to build the
target differs from what was used previously.
Targets built with
.Cm generator
rules are not rebuilt if the command changes.
.Pp
If the
.Cm clean
tool is used, the targets are cleaned instead.
When a target is cleaned, it is removed and are all of its inputs are cleaned.
Targets with no generating actions are never removed.
Targets built with
.Sy generator
rules are only removed if
.Fl g
is specified.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Switch working directory to
.Ar dir
before building.
.It Fl d
Enable debug output.
If
.Ar debugmode
is
.Cm explain ,
print messages explaining why outputs were dirty.
.It Fl f
Load manifest from
.Ar buildfile
instead of build.ninja.
.It Fl j
Run up to
.Ar maxjobs
jobs in parallel (default based on number of CPUs).
.It Fl k
Allow up to
.Ar maxfail
job failures.
If not positive, allow any number of job failures.
.It Fl v
Print full commands instead of just
.Sy description .
.It Fl t
Instead of building, invoke a subtool.
All arguments and flags after the subtool are interpreted by the subtool.
Currently,
.Cm clean
is the only subtool.
.It Fl g
When cleaning, also clean outputs of
.Sy generator
actions.
.It Fl r
.Ar targets
are interpreted as rules, and all outputs of actions with the specified rule
types will be cleaned instead.
