[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~mcf/samurai.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~mcf/samurai)

samurai is a ninja-compatible build tool written in C99 with a focus on
simplicity, speed, and portability.

## Status

samurai implements the ninja build language through version 1.9.0 except
for MSVC dependency handling (`deps = msvc`). It uses the same format
for `.ninja_log` and `.ninja_deps` as ninja, currently version 5 and 4
respectively.

It is feature-complete and supports most of the same options as ninja.

## Requirements

samurai requires various POSIX.1-2008 interfaces.

## Differences from ninja

samurai tries to match ninja behavior as much as possible, but there
are several cases where it is slightly different:

- samurai uses the [variable lookup order] documented in the ninja manual,
  while ninja has a quirk ([ninja-build/ninja#1516]) that if the build
  edge has no variable bindings, the variable is looked up in file scope
  *before* the rule-level variables.
- samurai schedules jobs using a stack, so the last scheduled job is
  the first to execute, while ninja schedules jobs based on the pointer
  value of the edge structure (they are stored in a `std::set<Edge*>`),
  so the first to execute depends on the address returned by `malloc`.
  This may result in build failures due to insufficiently specified
  dependencies in the project's build system.
- samurai does not post-process the job output in any way, so if it
  includes escape sequences they will be preserved, while ninja strips
  escape sequences if standard output is not a terminal. Some build
  systems, like meson, force color output from gcc by default using
  `-fdiagnostics-color=always`, so if you plan to save the output to a
  log, you should pass `-Db_colorout=auto` to meson.
